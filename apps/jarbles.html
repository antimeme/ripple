                Unfortunately Java applets died in 2018.  Plugin
                systems such as NPAPI introduce complexity and
                security problems so browser vendors (including
                Mozilla and Google) have taken aggressive steps to
                eliminate them.  This is understandable but also
                frustrating.  JavaScript has been better way to
                deliver web applications for quite some time but not
                everyone has the time or resources to rewrite
                everything every ten years.  Many useful web resources
                are now practically unavailable due to short sighted
                vendor practices (mainly I mean making plugins
                available in the first place, but to a lesser extent
                because they were withdrawn).

                Jarbles itself isn't
                dead just yet: it's still possible to
                <a href="../ripple.jar">download the jar file</a>
                and run it from a command line:
            </p><p><code>java -jar ripple.jar jarbles</code></p>
        </object>
    </object>
</div>

<p>
    Jarbles is an implementation of Abalone in
    <a href="http://java.com/">Java</a>.  The program divides
    available space into three sections.  The largest is the game
    board itself on the left.  Clicking the start, end and target
    positions makes a move.  The top right section is a move pane.  A
    piece of the color which must make the next move is in the center.
    When something is selected on the board additional pieces will
    appear to indicate which directions are currently legal moves.
    Clicking one of these will make that move and might be more
    intuitive for some players.  When one color wins the game, either
    by forcing six pieces off the board or running the opponent out of
    time, the center of the move pane will be empty and all other
    cells will show the winning color.  Finally, on the bottom right
    is the score pane which shows all captured pieces as well as the
    current timers.  The program has limited support for themes
    (there's an alternative theme called <q>Aqua</q>) and a simplistic
    computer opponent that uses alpha-beta pruning.

    Jarbles determines the sizes of everything from pieces to text
    dynamically so it can scale smoothly.  The board is made
    as large as possible within the given dimensions so the program is
    usable in most reasonable sizes.  (When made small enough it
    becomes difficult to visually distinguish different cells and
    eventually individual pixes will cover more than one cell.)
