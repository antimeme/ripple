        (You're seeing this text instead of an interactive Java
        applet.  Perhaps you don't have Java installed or the browser
        plugin enabled.  You can execute this program directly by
        downloading <a href="../ripple.jar">ripple.jar</a> and
        typing <code>java -jar ripple.jar jarbles</code> at a command
        prompt.)

<p>
  Jarbles is an implementation of Abalone
  in <a href="http://java.com/">Java</a>.
</p>

<p>
  This applet divides available space into three sections.  The
  largest is the game board itself on the left.  Clicking the
  start, end and target positions makes a move.  The top right
  section is a move pane.  A piece of the color which must make
  the next move is in the center.  When something is selected on
  the board additional pieces will appear to indicate which
  directions are currently legal moves.  Clicking one of these
  will make that move and might be more intuitive for some
  players.  When one color wins the game, either by forcing six
  pieces off the board or running the opponent out of time, the
  center of the move pane will be empty and all other cells will
  show the winning color.  Finally, on the bottom right is the
  score pane which shows all captured pieces as well as the
  current timers.
</p>

<p>
  This program determines the sizes of everything from pieces to
  text dynamically so the applet can scale smoothly.  The board is
  made as large as possible within the given dimensions so the
  applet is usable under almost any circumstances.  (Of course,
  when made small enough it becomes difficult to visually
  distinguish different cells and eventually individual pixes will
  cover more than one cell.)
</p>

<p>
  There are some additional features that are not yet accessible
  through this applet.  For instance there is theme support, a
  simple computer controlled opponent and a standalone application
  which can be executed from the command line.
