                An interactive Java applet should be here but Java
                isn't installed or enabled in your browser.  You can
                download <a href="../ripple.jar">ripple.jar</a>.
                After that you could type
                <code>java -jar ripple.jar jarbles</code> at a command
                prompt to run this program or unpack the archive and
                examine the source code.  Using a RedHat based system?
                Try <code>sudo yum -y install icedtea-web</code>.
                Using a Debian based system? ls Try
                <code>sudo apt-get install icedtea-plugin</code>.

<p>
    Jarbles is an implementation of Abalone in
    <a href="http://java.com/">Java</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This applet divides available space into three sections.  The
    largest is the game board itself on the left.  Clicking the start,
    end and target positions makes a move.  The top right section is a
    move pane.  A piece of the color which must make the next move is
    in the center.  When something is selected on the board additional
    pieces will appear to indicate which directions are currently
    legal moves.  Clicking one of these will make that move and might
    be more intuitive for some players.  When one color wins the game,
    either by forcing six pieces off the board or running the opponent
    out of time, the center of the move pane will be empty and all
    other cells will show the winning color.  Finally, on the bottom
    right is the score pane which shows all captured pieces as well as
    the current timers.
</p>

<p>
    This program determines the sizes of everything from pieces to
    text dynamically so the applet can scale smoothly.  The board is
    made as large as possible within the given dimensions so the
    applet is usable under almost any circumstances.  (Of course, when
    made small enough it becomes difficult to visually distinguish
    different cells and eventually individual pixes will cover more
    than one cell.)
</p>

<p>
    There are some additional features that are not yet accessible
    through this applet.  For instance there is theme support, a
    simple computer controlled opponent and a standalone application
    which can be executed from the command line.
