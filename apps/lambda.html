    Lambda Calculus is an abstract model of computation.  Other models,
    such as the Turing Machine, are equivalent (this is part of the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis"
    >Church-Turing Thesis</a>).  This program implements lambda
    expressions, normal order reduction and a library of useful
    functions.  The lambda calculus itself contains only variables,
    grouping, abstractions and applications.  Notice that this does
    not include boolean logic, data structures, recursion or numbers.
    And yet the library included here contains all of these things
    because lambda calculus provides a universal foundation on which
    any computation can be built.

<h2><a name="definition">Definition</a></h2>
<p>
    A lambda calculus expression is composed from four patterns:
</p><ul><li>
    Variable: any identifier other than <code>lambda</code> which
    does not contain <code>λ</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>(</code>
    or <code>)</code>
</li><li>
    Grouping: <code>(</code> [expression] <code>)</code>
</li><li>
    Abstraction: <code>lambda</code>
    [variable]<code>.</code>[expression]
</li><li>
    Application: [expression1] [expression2]
</li></ul><p>
    Any combination of these components is a valid lambda calculus
    expression.  Note that while all lambda calculus abstractions
    accept exactly one argument, in practice we allow more than one by
    providing additional variables between the lambda and the dot.
    For example, instead of writing
    <code>λa.λb.a</code> we will usually write
    <code>λa b.a</code> instead.  These have the same meaning.  Here
    are some examples:
</p><ul><li><code>
    λa.a
</code></li><li><code>
    λn f a.n (λg h.h (g f)) (λu.a) (λu.u)
</code></li><li><code>FIX (λf n.(EQUAL? n ZERO) ONE
     (MULTIPLY n (f (PREDECESSOR n))))
</code></li></li></ul><p>
    Variables within a lambda calculus expression are either bound or
    free.  Any variable following a lambda is bound in the expression
    following the next dot.  A variable not bound in this way is free.
    The first two examples above have no free variables.  The third
    has many free variables, including <code>FIX</code>,
    <code>EQUAL?</code> and <code>MULTIPLY</code>.
</p><p>
    Any lambda expression with no free variables is called a
    combinator.  Many combinators are useful enough that we give them
    names.  For example <code>λa.a</code> is called the identity
    combinator.  This is the simplest possible combinator.  In 1985
    Raymond Smullyan wrote a book entitled
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird">To
        Mock a Mockingbird</a> which is the source of many of these
    names.  Here are some examples:
</p><ul><li>
    Identity: <code>λa.a</code>
</li><li>
    Mockingbird: <code>λm.m m</code>
</li><li>
    Kestrel: <code>λa b.a</code>
</li><li>
    Kite: <code>λa b.b</code>
</li><li>
    Cardinal: <code>λa b c.a c b</code>
</li><li>
    Bluebird: <code>λa b c.a (b c)</code>
</li><li>
    Thrush: <code>λa b.b a</code>
</li><li>
    Virio: <code>λa b f.f a b</code>
</li><li>
    Starling: <code>λa b c.a c (b c)</code>
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="computation">Computation</a></h2>
<p>
    Computation in lambda calculus is performed by reductions.  A
    reduction applies an expression to an abstraction by replacing
    all instances of a variable with that expression inside the body
    of the abstraction.  For example, let's reduce the following
    lambda expression:
</p><ul><li>
    <code>(λa.a) VALUE</code>
</li><li>
    <code>a [a := VALUE]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>VALUE</code>
</li></ul><p>
    The first step above is our original expression.  In the second
    step we replace an abstraction with its body and note the need to
    replace all instances of its variable with some value.  In the
    third step we perform that replacement and the reduction is
    complete.  That's simple in this case, but there may be no
    instance to replace or there may be more than one.  Here is
    another example where the substition must be done twice:
</p><ul><li>
    <code>(λf a.f (f a)) λb.b</code>
</li><li>
    <code>λa.f (f a) [f := (λb.b)]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>λa.(λb.b) ((λb.b) a)</code>
</li></ul><p>
    Once a reduction is complete it may be possible to further reduce
    the expression as it is in the example above.  In the following
    example, we reduce three times:
</p><ul><li>
    <code>(λn.n ((λa b.a) (λa b.b)) (λa b.a)) (λa b.b)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>n ((λa b.a) (λa b.b)) (λa b.a) [n := (λa b.b)]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>(λa b.b) ((λa b.a) (λa b.b)) (λa b.a)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>(λb.b) [a := ((λa b.a) (λa b.b))] (λa b.a)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>(λb.b) (λa b.a)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>b [b := (λa b.a)]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>λa b.a</code>
</li></ul><p>
    At the end of this process no further reductions are possible.
    When this happens we say that the expression is in normal form.
    If an expression has a normal form there is only one.  This is the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Rosser_theorem"
    >Church-Rosser Theorem</a>.
</p><p>
    Not all expressions have a normal form.  What would an expression
    without a normal form look like?  One example is the mockingbird
    combinator applied to itself:
</p><ul><li>
    <code>(λm.m m) (λm.m m)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>m m [m := (λm.m m)]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>(λm.m m) (λm.m m)</code>
</li></ul><p>
    Our reduction is complete, but we're back where we started.  This
    expression can be further reduced but it will never make progress
    toward any conclusion.  As a consequence it will never reach a
    normal form.
</p>
<h2><a name="halting">Halting Problem</a></h2>
<p>
    Let's use the lambda calculus to take on the famous
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting
        problem</a>.  Can we write a program that accepts another
    program as input and returns <code>TRUE</code> if it has a normal
    form and <code>FALSE</code> if it doesn't?  The answer is no.
    Let's use the lambda calculus to understand why.
</p><p>
    Suppose we could solve the problem.  Suppose a lambda
    expression which we'll call <code>HALTS?</code> accepts any
    program and after a finite number of steps reduces to
    <code>TRUE</code> if the input has a normal form and
    <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.  Here is what that might look like:
</p><blockquote><code>
      HALTS? p
</code></blockquote><p>
    Maybe we aren't clever enough to figure out how to implement this
    ourselves but it certainly seems like it might be possible.  But
    we can use the existance of such a program to prove that it's not
    possible.  Let's start by doing this:
</p><blockquote><code>
      (λp.(HALTS? (p p)) ((λm.m m) (λm.m m)) TRUE)
</code></blockquote><p>
    Given an input program that can be applied to itself with a normal
    form this program reduces to the mockingbird applied to itself,
    which has no normal form.  Given a program which has no normal
    form when applied to itself -- such as the mockingbird -- this
    program reduces to <code>TRUE</code> and therefore does have a normal
    form.  So it does the opposite of the program it has been given.
    This may seem silly but it's clearly a valid combination of
    expressions.  But what happens when we apply this program to
    itself?
</p><blockquote><code>
    (λm.m m) (λp.(HALTS? (p p)) ((λm.m m) (λm.m m)) TRUE)
</code></blockquote><p>
    Does it halt?  Let's ask our halting checker:
</p><blockquote><code>
    HALTS? ((λm.m m) (λp.(HALTS? (p p)) ((λm.m m) (λm.m m)) TRUE))
</code></blockquote><p>
    What does this reduce to?  Well, it can't possibly reduce to
    <code>TRUE</code>!  If it did that would mean
    <code>HALTS? (p p)</code> must also reduce to
    <code>TRUE</code> which means the outer expression reduces to
    <code>(λm.m m) (λm.m m)</code> which clearly does not halt.  But
    it also can't reduce to <code>FALSE</code>!  If it did then
    <code>HALTS? (p p)</code> must also reduce to <code>FALSE</code>
    and that means the outer expression reduces to <code>TRUE</code>
    which clearly halts.  Our original assumption that
    <code>HALTS?</code> always reduces in a finite number of steps
    to either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> is clearly
    impossible!
</p>
<h2><a name="instructions">Instructions</a></h2>
<p>
    As we will see, lambda calculus is not an efficient way to perform
    computations.  However it's still impressive that such a simple
    system is universal.  Select a library function from the drop down
    box to study it.  Can you understand how it works?  Or type your
    own lambda expressions into the text area.  It's okay to type the
    word <code>lambda</code> rather than the <code>λ</code> symbol as
    long as you put a space between it and the variable name.
</p><p>
    Click the <q>Reduce</q> button to perform a single step of
    computation.  Most computations require a large number of steps,
    so you can instead click the <q>Repeat</q> button to continuously
    perform reductions.  This will terminate when no more reductions
    are possible, if that ever happens.  You can see what happens to a
    program that does not terminate by copying and pasting the
    following:
</p><blockquote><pre>
      (lambda n.n n) (lambda m.m m)
</pre></blockquote><p>
    Click <q>Repeat</q> to watch this reduce indefinitely.  Click
    <q>Reduce</q> to stop the process; it will never stop on its own.
</p>
<h2><a name="arithmetic">Arithmetic</a></h2>
<p>
    Let's explore a computation that does terminate.  We'll use the
    built in library to add two numbers.  Copy and paste the following
    into the text area:
</p><blockquote><pre>
      ADD TWO THREE
</pre></blockquote><p>
    This will not reduce further since all three of the terms here are
    free variables.  It's one thing to type these words but lambda
    calculus itself assigns no meaning to numbers like two and three,
    much less to addition.  We will solve this problem using
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church
        Encoding</a>.  Instead of numbers we will use a function that
    takes two arguments and applies the first to the second a number
    of times.  This means that <code>TWO</code> can be replaced by
    <code>λf a.f (f a)</code> and <code>THREE</code> can be replaced
    by <code>λf a.f (f (f a))</code>.  It's possible to implement
    addition as well.  We could do this by editing the expression
    directly but this program contains a library that will do this
    automatically.
</p><p>
    Click the <q>Library</q> button to replace these free variables
    with combinators.  (In this case once is enough, but some library
    functions use other library functions so it will sometimes be
    necessary to keep clicking to get to a final expression.)  Now
    that there are no free variables we can click the <q>Repeat</q>
    to reduce this to a normal form, which takes six steps.  But what
    did it reduce to?  This is a function that takes two arguments and
    applies the first to the second five times.  That is the Church
    Numeral representation of five!
</p><p>
    In this case it's easy to count the number of function
    applications but how can we be sure in other cases?  We can use
    the library to check.  Change the buffer by prepending so that it
    looks like this:
</p><blockquote><pre>
      EQUAL? FIVE λf a.f (f (f (f (f a))))
</pre></blockquote><p>
    Click the <q>Library</q> button until there are no more free
    variables.  Then click repeat and get comfortable.  This will take
    134 steps and considerable time.  But it will return the lambda
    calculus expression: <code>lambda a b.a</code>  What does that
    mean?  Click the <q>Discover</q> button to find out which library
    function this matches.  You should see that it's <code>TRUE</code>.
</p><p>
    We can check that this result is meaningful by trying an incorrect
    equation:
</p><blockquote><pre>
      EQUAL? SEVEN λf a.f (f (f (f (f a))))
</pre></blockquote><p>
    Now after 146 steps this reduces to <code>FALSE</code>.  That makes
    sense, doesn't it?  Seven is not equal to five.
</p><p>
    Another way we could have checked is to select <code>FIVE</code>
    from the drop down box.  This produces the same expression.  We
    can see that both the answer to or original expression and the
    library version of <code>FIVE</code> are the same.
</p><p>
    We could instead do all of this in one program.  Try this:
</p><blockquote><pre>
      EQUAL? FIVE (ADD TWO THREE)
</pre></blockquote><p>
    After 146 steps this reduces to <code>TRUE</code>.  Replace five
    with some other number to get <code>FALSE</code>.  Try other numbers
    in expressions like this to confirm that correct equations reduce
    to <code>TRUE</code> and incorrect equations reduce to
    <code>FALSE</code>.
</p><p>
    <code>GREATER?</code>, <code>LESS?</code>, <code>SUBTRACT</code>,
    <code>MULTIPLY</code>, <code>DIVIDE</code> and <code>POWER</code>
    are also available.  Try creating simple arithmetic expressions
    like this one:
</p><blockquote><pre>
      GREATER? (SUBTRACT FIVE TWO) TWO
</pre></blockquote><p>
    This should reduce to <code>TRUE</code> in 63 steps.
</p>
<h2><a name="recusion">Recursion</a></h2>
<p>
    Sometimes computations are more convenient to express in terms
    of recursion.  This means a function calls itself on a reduced
    form of its input in order to break down a problem.  Of course,
    lambda calculas has no support for recursion.  Even so, our
    library contains a recursive function called <code>FACTORIAL</code>.
    Here is an example of this function you can try running yourself:
</p><blockquote><pre>
      FACTORIAL THREE
</pre></blockquote><p>
    After 2,907 steps this arrives at the Church Numeral representation
    of <code>SIX</code> (because three factorial is three times two
    times one).  This representation of six looks a little different.
    In particular, it uses a different variable name.  We can check
    that this is <code>SIX</code> the same way we compared our earlier
    result to <code>FIVE</code>.
</p><p>
    Computing <code>FACTORIAL FIVE</code> takes 50,586 steps and a
    long time but it produces this:
</p><p><code>
    λc a.c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c
    (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c
    (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c
    (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c
    (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c
    (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c (c a)
    )))))))))) )))))))))) ))))))))))) )))))))))) ))))))))) )))))))))
    )))))))))) )))))))))) ))))))))))) )))))))))) ))))))))) )))))))))
</code></p><p>
    So how does this work?  It makes use of the <code>FIX</code>
    combinator -- also known as the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator">Y
        combinator</a>.  The Y combinator causes a function to be
    called with itself as an argument.  This makes it possible for
    the function to call itself without any support for recursion in
    the programming environment.
