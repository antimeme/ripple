<title>Lambda Calculus</title>
<h1>Lambda Calculus</h1>
<div class="lambda" data-library="true" data-sk="true"></div>


<p>
    Lambda Calculus is an abstract model of computation.  Other models,
    such as the Turing Machine, are equivalent (this is part of the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis"
    >Church-Turing Thesis</a>).  This program implements lambda
    expressions, normal order reduction and a library of useful
    functions.  The lambda calculus itself contains only variables,
    grouping, abstractions and applications.  Notice that this does
    not include boolean logic, data structures, recursion or numbers.
    And yet the library included here contains all of these things
    because lambda calculus provides a universal foundation on which
    any computation can be built.

<h2><a name="definition">Definition</a></h2>
<p>
    A lambda calculus expression is composed from four patterns:
</p><ul><li>
    Variable: any identifier other than <code>lambda</code> which
    does not contain <code>λ</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>(</code>
    or <code>)</code>
</li><li>
    Grouping: <code>(</code> [expression] <code>)</code>
</li><li>
    Abstraction: <code>lambda</code>
    [variable]<code>.</code>[expression]
</li><li>
    Application: [expression1] [expression2]
</li></ul><p>
    Any combination of these components is a valid lambda calculus
    expression.  Note that while all lambda calculus abstractions
    accept exactly one argument, in practice we allow more than one by
    providing additional variables between the lambda and the dot.
    For example, instead of writing
    <code>λa.λb.a</code> we will usually write
    <code>λa b.a</code> instead.  These have the same meaning.  Here
    are some examples:
</p><ul><li><code>
    λa.a
</code></li><li><code>
    λn f a.n (λg h.h (g f)) (λu.a) (λu.u)
</code></li><li><code>FIX (λf n.(EQUAL? n ZERO) ONE
     (MULTIPLY n (f (PREDECESSOR n))))
</code></li></li></ul><p>
    Variables within a lambda calculus expression are either bound or
    free.  Any variable following a lambda is bound in the expression
    following the next dot.  A variable not bound in this way is free.
    The first two examples above have no free variables.  The third
    has many free variables, including <code>FIX</code>,
    <code>EQUAL?</code> and <code>MULTIPLY</code>.
</p><p>
    Any lambda expression with no free variables is called a
    combinator.  Many combinators are useful enough that we give them
    names.  For example <code>λa.a</code> is called the identity
    combinator.  This is the simplest possible combinator.  In 1985
    Raymond Smullyan wrote a book entitled
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird">To
        Mock a Mockingbird</a> which is the source of many of these
    names.  Here are some examples:
</p><ul><li>
    Identity: <code>λa.a</code>
</li><li>
    Mockingbird: <code>λm.m m</code>
</li><li>
    Kestrel: <code>λa b.a</code>
</li><li>
    Kite: <code>λa b.b</code>
</li><li>
    Cardinal: <code>λa b c.a c b</code>
</li><li>
    Bluebird: <code>λa b c.a (b c)</code>
</li><li>
    Thrush: <code>λa b.b a</code>
</li><li>
    Virio: <code>λa b f.f a b</code>
</li><li>
    Starling: <code>λa b c.a c (b c)</code>
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="computation">Computation</a></h2>
<p>
    Computation in lambda calculus is performed by reductions.  A
    reduction applies an expression to an abstraction by replacing
    all instances of a variable with that expression inside the body
    of the abstraction.  For example, let's reduce the following
    lambda expression:
</p><ul><li>
    <code>(λa.a) VALUE</code>
</li><li>
    <code>a [a := VALUE]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>VALUE</code>
</li></ul><p>
    The first step above is our original expression.  In the second
    step we replace an abstraction with its body and note the need to
    replace all instances of its variable with some value.  In the
    third step we perform that replacement and the reduction is
    complete.  That's simple in this case, but there may be no
    instance to replace or there may be more than one.  Here is
    another example where the substition must be done twice:
</p><ul><li>
    <code>(λf a.f (f a)) λb.b</code>
</li><li>
    <code>λa.f (f a) [f := (λb.b)]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>λa.(λb.b) ((λb.b) a)</code>
</li></ul><p>
    Once a reduction is complete it may be possible to further reduce
    the expression as it is in the example above.  In the following
    example, we reduce three times:
</p><ul><li>
    <code>(λn.n ((λa b.a) (λa b.b)) (λa b.a)) (λa b.b)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>n ((λa b.a) (λa b.b)) (λa b.a) [n := (λa b.b)]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>(λa b.b) ((λa b.a) (λa b.b)) (λa b.a)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>(λb.b) [a := ((λa b.a) (λa b.b))] (λa b.a)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>(λb.b) (λa b.a)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>b [b := (λa b.a)]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>λa b.a</code>
</li></ul><p>
    At the end of this process no further reductions are possible.
    When this happens we say that the expression is in normal form.
    If an expression has a normal form there is only one.  This is the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Rosser_theorem"
    >Church-Rosser Theorem</a>.
</p><p>
    Not all expressions have a normal form.  What would an expression
    without a normal form look like?  One example is the mockingbird
    combinator applied to itself:
</p><ul><li>
    <code>(λm.m m) (λm.m m)</code>
</li><li>
    <code>m m [m := (λm.m m)]</code>
</li><li>
    <code>(λm.m m) (λm.m m)</code>
</li></ul><p>
    Our reduction is complete, but we're back where we started.  This
    expression can be further reduced but it will never make progress
    toward any conclusion.  As a consequence it will never reach a
    normal form.
</p>
<h2><a name="instructions">Instructions</a></h2>
<p>
    As we will see, lambda calculus is not an efficient way to perform
    computations.  However it's still impressive that such a simple
    system is universal.  Select a library function from the drop down
    box to study it.  Can you understand how it works?  Or type your
    own lambda expressions into the text area.  It's okay to type the
    word <code>lambda</code> rather than the <code>λ</code> symbol as
    long as you put a space between it and the variable name.
</p><p>
    Click the <q>Reduce</q> button to perform a single step of
    computation.  Most computations require a large number of steps,
    so you can instead click the <q>Repeat</q> button to continuously
    perform reductions.  This will terminate when no more reductions
    are possible, if that ever happens.  You can see what happens to a
    program that does not terminate by copying and pasting the
    following:
</p><div class="lambda" data-delay="500"
         data-expr="(λn.n n) λm.m m">
</div><p>
    Click <q>Repeat</q> to watch this reduce indefinitely.  Click
    <q>Reset</q> to stop the process; it will never stop on its own.
</p>
<h2><a name="arithmetic">Arithmetic</a></h2>
<p>
    Let's explore a computation that does terminate.  We'll use the
    built in library to add two numbers.
</p><div class="lambda" data-library="true" data-expr="+ 3 2">
</div><p>
    This is a valid expression, but the symbols have no meaning in
    lambda calculus.  We'll solve this problem by replacing them with
    expressions from a built in library.  Click the <q>Library</q>
    button to do this.
</p><p>
    Our library replaces numbers with 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church
        Encoded</a> numerals.  A number is represented by a function
    that accepts two arguments and applies the first to the second
    that number of times.  This means <code>TWO</code> has been
    replaced by <code>λf a.f (f a)</code> and <code>THREE</code>
    has been replaced by <code>λf a.f (f (f a))</code>.  Instead of
    the addition operator, we have a function that applies the
    successor repeatedly using one of the numbers.
</p><p>
    Click the <q>Reduce</q> button to perform a single reduction.  This
    still leaves a complex expression that doesn't directly represent
    any number.  It will take five more clicks to get to an expression
    in normal form.  Instead of doing all that clicking, the
    <q>Repeat</q> button can be used to complete the process
    automatically.  A small delay (which can be increased or decrased
    using the slider) is introduced between each reduction.
    Click the <q>Reset</q> button to restore the original expression
    and try this a few different ways.
</p><p>
    Even after the expression is reduced to normal form, it may not be
    obvious just what we've computed.  In this case, we can see that
    the result is a function which takes two arguments and applies the
    first to the second five times.  That's the Church Numeral
    representation of five, which is what we should expect from adding
    three to two.  Use the <q>Discover</q>
    button to replace the result with a value from the library, if
    possible.  In this example you should get the number five.
</p><p>
    There's one more shortcut to try.  The <q>Go</q> button does
    evertyhing we've described here in one step: first it replaces
    symbols with values from the library, then it reduces until a
    normal form is reached and finally it looks for a library value
    to replace it with.  Try clicking <q>Reset</q> followed by <q>Go</q>
    above.  You can also try replacing the numbers to see that you
    still get a correct answer.
</p><p>
    Consider this:
</p><div class="lambda" data-library="true"
         data-expr="EQUAL? 5 λf a.f (f (f (f (f a))))">
</div><p>
    Click the <q>Go</q> button.  After 134 steps you should get
    <code>TRUE</code>.  That makes sense.  We can check that this
    result is meaningful by trying an incorrect equation:
</p><div class="lambda" data-library="true"
         data-expr="EQUAL? 7 λf a.f (f (f (f (f a))))">
</div><p>
    Now after 146 steps this reduces to <code>0</code>.  What
    happened?  As it turns out, in lambda calculus we represent
    zero and false using the same expression.  This means the
    program needs to pick one to recognize.  Try putting
    <code>FALSE</code> in the text area and clicking <q>Library</q>
    to see that these are the same thing.
</p><p>
    We can build more complicated expressions.  For example:
</p><div class="lambda" data-library="true"
         data-expr="EQUAL? 5 (+ 2 3)">
</div><p>
    After 146 steps this reduces to <code>TRUE</code>.  Replace five
    with some other number to get <code>0</code> (which is the same
    as <code>FALSE</code>.  Try other numbers in expressions like this
    to confirm that the correct results are reached.
</p><p>
    <code>GREATER?</code>, <code>LESS?</code>, <code>SUBTRACT</code>,
    <code>MULTIPLY</code>, <code>DIVIDE</code> and <code>POWER</code>
    are also available.  Try creating simple arithmetic expressions
    like this one:
</p><div class="lambda" data-library="true"
         data-expr="GREATER? (- 5 2) 2">
</div><p>
    This should reduce to <code>TRUE</code> in 63 steps.
</p>
<h2><a name="recusion">Recursion</a></h2>
<p>
    Sometimes computations are more convenient to express in terms
    of recursion.  This means a function calls itself on a reduced
    form of its input in order to break down a problem.  Of course,
    lambda calculas has no support for recursion.  Even so, our
    library contains a recursive function called <code>FACTORIAL</code>.
    Here is an example of this function you can try running yourself:
</p><div class="lambda" data-library="true"
         data-expr="FACTORIAL 3">
</div><p>
    After 646 steps this arrives at the Church Numeral representation
    of <code>6</code> (because three factorial is three times two
    times one).
</p><p>
    Computing <code>FACTORIAL 4</code> takes 3,873 steps and
    results in Church Numeral <code>24</code>.  Computing
    <code>FACTORIAL 5</code> takes 26,899 steps and a long time but it
    reduces to a function of two variables that applies the first to
    the second one hundred twenty times.  5! = 5 &times; 4 &times; 3
    &times; 2 &times; 1 = 120.  So how does this work?  It makes use
    of the <code>FIX</code> combinator -- also known as the
    fixed point or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator"
    >Y combinator</a>.  The Y combinator followed by a function
    reduces to that function followed by an application of the Y
    combinator to that function.  This means it will call the function
    with itself as an argument indefinitely.  As long as the function
    this is applied to has some terminating condition this won't
    reduce forever.  This makes it possible for the function to call
    itself without any support for recursion in the programming
    environment.
