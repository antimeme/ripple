<h1>Streya Design</h1>
<p>
    Streya is a systemic web game set in the Kuiper belt.  It attempts
    to strike a balance between realism and flexibility.  This means
    players must be able to understand things at a high level without
    detailed knowledge of the underlying systems.  Carefully managing
    lower level systems must create advantages but not usually
    decisive ones.  This is meant to support a collection of
    interconnected games with emphasis on different mechanics.
