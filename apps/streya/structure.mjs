/**
 * A station is a rotating habitat which contains many structures.
 * Stations have cylindrical topology and represent a surface that
 * spins to create artificial gravity using centrifugal force.
 * Objects within the station are pressed against the surface due
 * to its rotation.  Stations usually have a reactor and docking
 * rings that are separate from the cylinder because these don't
 * need to rotate.  Special elevators accelerate passengers and
 * cargo that need to enter the habitat.
 *
 * <p>Here are some facts about artificial gravity created this way:
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gravity).
 * Rotation at or less than two revolutions per minute should limit
 * inner ear problems for humans.  This means a rotation period of
 * at least thirty seconds.  According to the same source, the
 * rotation period T = 2Ï€(r/a)^1/2 where r is the radius of the
 * station and a is the acceleration.  Plugging in 9.8 for
 * acceleration comparable to Earth gravity and assuming the
 * circumference of the cylinder contains six square districts
 * each with a side length of each with side length of 256 meters we
 * get a period of 31.38 seconds.  This means a station must have
 * at least six (possibly empty) districts along the axis that wraps
 * around in order to be comfortable.</p> */
