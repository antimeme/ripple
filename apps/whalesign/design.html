<h1>Whalesign: Design</h1>
<p>
    Whalesign is a turn based game about hunting demon whales in a
    fictional world with late-nineteenth century technology.  The
    player controls the crew of a well armed steam ship and must kill
    their prey, but demon whales fight back.
</p><p>
    The game has two modes.  First is port mode, where the player can
    make choices about how to equip their ship and consider rumors
    about what kinds of demon whales are in various regions.  These
    rumors are usually true but not entirely reliable.  The second is
    battle mode where the player gives orders to the crew.  Battle
    mode ends when the demon whale dies, when the ship runs out of
    hull points and capsizes or when the of the crew is incapacitated.
</p>
<h2>Demon Whales</h2>
<p>
    A demon whale is a ferocious beast but it can be killed.  Each
    whale has a unique combination of traits and abilities.  All of
    them can wreck a ship by battering it to pieces or capsizing it
    and most have at least one special attack.  They can be small,
    medium or large.  At any moment the demon whale is in one of a
    small number of states, which deterines which kinds of attacks and
    defenses it can use.
</p><ul><li>
    Surfaced: partially above the waves.  Demon whales must enter
    this state every so often in order to breathe.  Some can hold
    their breath longer than others.
</li><li>
    Submerged: visible below the surface.  Demon whales in this state
    can usually be seen but are resistant to cannon shells and harder
    to target.
</li><li>
    Deep: far below the surface.  Direct targetting is impossible
    against whales in this state, but tow lines and reackoning may
    make it possible to harm one using depth charges.  Demon whales
    start the battle in this state.
</li><li>
    Dead: getting them to this state takes a work but that's the job.
</li></ul>
<p>
    Demon whales have a variety of potential attacks:
</p><ul><li>
    Ram: all demon whales can do this when surfaced or submerged, but
    not when deep.  This does moderate damage to the ship and creates
    strong tremmors that can knock over crew members.
</li><li>
    Bite: demon whales with especially sharp teeth can bite into
    ships, causing heavy damage and mild tremmors that might knock
    crew members over.
</li><li>
    Pull: a whale tethered to a ship may move deep in an attempt to
    damage the ship.
</li><li>
    Spikes: some demon whales can shoot spikes when surfaced that
    act as a powerful anti-personel weapon.
</li><li>
    Summon: some demon whales can call upon mermen to climb onto
    ships to kill or at least distract the crew.
</li><li>
    Tentacle: long protrusions that can act on the deck of the ship.
    These can attack crew, slam the deck or grab the ship in an
    attempt to drag it to Davy Jones' locker.
</li></ul>
<p>
    Every whale has one of the following sizes:
</p>
<ul><li>
    Small: 500 - 1500 hits.  Can be dragged by the ship when tethered.
</li><li>
    Medium: 1000 - 3000 hits.  Can't be dragged when tethered, but
    suffers reduced movement speed.
</li><li>
    Large: 2000 - 6000 hits.  Drags the ship when tethered at a reduced
    movement speed.
</li><li>
    Huge: 4000 - 12000 hits.  Drags the ship when tethered at full
    movement speed.
</li></ul>
<h2>Ships</h2>
<p>
    Each ship consists of a top deck and a bridge.  There are
    several stations that the crew can use.
</p><ul><li>
    Hardpoint: here crew can operate mounted weapons such as
    explosive harpoon guns, cannons and the like.
</li><li>
    Bollard: protrusions with ropes or chains that crew can use to
    lash deck items like cannons or ammuniction barrels in place.
</li><li>
    Locker: here crew can retrieve a life preservers, cutlasses,
    rifles or other items.
</li><li>
    Stairs: here a crew member can go below deck to be relatively
    safe -- assuming the ship survives.  Incapacitated crew members
    can be dragged here.
</li><li>
    Bridge: here the ships wheel can be used to steer.
</li></ul>
<p>
    Ships bring a variety of mounted weapons.
</p><ul><li>
    Cannon: fires shells that do heavy damage (50 - 100 hits).  These
    are most effective against surfaced whales but can still do some
    harm to submerged whales.
</li><li>
    Harpoon Gun: launches sharp spears into the body of a demon
    whale to weaken (and eventually kill) it.  (10 - 15 hits)
</li><li>
    Tethered Harpoon Gun: like the harpoon gun, but with a rope that
    can reel in smaller demon whales.  Larger ones can pull the
    ship by the rope, though it might snap.  Tethers can be released
    by reloading or cut with a cutlass.  (5 - 10 hits)
</li><li>
    Chain Harpoon Gun: much slower to reel in than the harpoon rope
    gun but also much less likely to break.  Chains can be released
    by reloading but are not practical to cut. (10 - 15 hits)
</li></ul>
<h2>Crew</h2>
<p>
    The player controls ten to twenty crew members.
</p><p>
    Crew members get 5 - 10 hits depending on stats.
</p><p>
    A crew member has a stability score that can be affected by some
    actions, but is reduced by shocks such as whales ramming the ship.
    When stability is low there is a chance the crew member will slip
    and even fall overboard.  Crew members can lash themselves to the
    deck but this limits their movement range.
</p><p>
    Each round a crew member gets 10 to 20 action points to be spent
    each round:
</p><ul><li>
    Move (2ap standing): repositions the crew member on the deck or
    bridge.  Not available to prone crew members.
</li><li>
    Stand (10ap prone):  This changes the state
    of the crew member to standing.
</li><li>
    Drop (1ap standing):  This changes the state
    of the crew member to prone.
</li><li>
    Grab/discard (1ap): collects or discards a personal item, such as
    a cutlass or rifle.
</li><li>
    Cut (5ap standing): draws a knife and deals slashing damage
    to a creature or object adjacent to the crew member. Automatically
    cuts ropes.
</li><li>
    Slash (4ap standing sword): deals slashing damage to a creature or
    object adjacent to the crew member.  Automatically cuts ropes.
</li><li>
    Stab (4ap standing sword): deals piercing damage to a creature
    or object adjacent to the crew member.
</li><li>
    Fire (4ap standing firearm): diels ballistic damage to a creature
    or object targetted by the crew member.
</li><li>
    Activate (3ap standing system): provides effort to and adjacent
    ship system, such as a cannon.
</li><li>
    Drag (3ap standing deckitem): moves a deck item or disabled crew
    member at a reduced movement speed.
</li><li>
    Brace (5ap standing deckitem): recover some stability.
</li></ul>
<p>
    
</p>
<p>
    Crew members can have a variety of roles:
</p><ul><li>
    Captain: gives a large boost to morale when active
</li><li>
    First Mate: gives a small boost to morale when active
</li><li>
    Quartermaster: manages provisions
</li><li>
</li></ul>
<p>
    Crew members have attributes and stats.  Attributes are immutable
    and determined when the crew member is created.  Stats can improve
    with experience as the crew member develops skills.
</p><p>
    Let's start with attributes:
</p><ul><li>
    Brawn: affects damage output
</li><li>
    Agility: affects stability
</li><li>
    Will: affects morale
</li><li>
    Sight: affects accuracy
</li></ul>
