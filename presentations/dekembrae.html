<h1>Dekembr&aelig;</h1>

<p>
    Dekembr&aelig; is a role playing game system intended to support
    table top and computer games with a variety of genres.
</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>
    Role playing games have been around for many decades but most
    have serious problems that undermine story telling.
</p>

<h4>Rolling Dice for Abilities</h4>
<p>
    In the earliest role playing games players rolled dice to
    determine character abilities.  This can be exciting but it
    creates important problems.  First, players lose the power to
    choose important aspects of their characters.  Second, the dice
    make it difficult to know whether a player cheated.  Finally,
    different players can have characters with substantial differences
    in power through no virtue or fault of their own.
</p>

<h4>Character Classes</h4>
<p>
    Most role playing games make players choose a character class as
    one of the earliest steps.  This simplifies the game for players,
    which is helpful.  However, in most games this constrains the
    player choices so much that the designers feel compelled to add
    a multi-class system -- usually a cumbersome one.
</p>

<h4>Escalating Physical Toughness</h4>
<p>
    As characters gain experience, they usually gain some form of hit
    points.  This makes experienced characters more difficult to kill
    but despite sometimes explicit explanations in source books, most
    game masters interpret this as a kind of physical resistance to
    damage.  This strains the story telling as characters endure
    increasingly absurd amounts of physical punishment.
</p>

<h4>Frequent Fumbles</h4>
<p>
    Most role playing games use flat probability distributions, in
    contrast to real world systems where bell curves are far more
    common.  This creates strange situations, such as experienced
    characters who fumble even basic tasks one time in twenty.
</p>

<h4>Awkward Balancing Mechanics</h4>
<p>
    Games in which characters can use powerful systems like fantasy
    magic must balance these abilities so that characters without such
    abilities still have important roles to play.  Unfortunately many
    role playing systems use implausible and poorly constructed
    balancing mechanisms, such as limiting powers to a small number of
    uses per day.  This strains credibility and undermines story
    telling when there are better alternatives available.
</p>

<h4>Experience Points for Kills</h4>
<p>
    The earliest role playing games rewareded characters with
    experience points for killing monsters.  This is a simple and
    direct mechanic, but it creates a structural incentive to solve as
    many problems as possible with violence.  Players who consider
    bribing or sneaking past enemies are forced to consider the loss
    of game mechanic rewards that have no direct role in the story.
</p>

<h4>Deterministic Character Speed</h4>
<p>
    In some role playing games characters have a fixed speed at which
    they can move.  This makes chase scenes predictable.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Character Abilities</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Brawn: physical toughness and strength</li>

    <li>Perception: managing complex sensory input</li>
    <li>Intellect: abstract problem solving</li>
    <li>Will: perserverance and determination</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Characters start with a score of 3 in all abilities.  Each can be
    increased by one point at a cost equal to the current value plus
    one.  A score of 4 for an ability is average.  Heroic characters
    get 50 points to spend.  Other kinds of characters may get fewer
    points to spend.

<p>
    Every skill has a base ability and a cost.  Characters spend skill
    points which are multiplied by the value of the base ability to
    get the effective skill level.  To determine how many skill
    points are needed to achieve <code>r</code> in a skill that costs
    <code>c</code> points with a base ability <code>b</code>
    compute <code>c(r + 1)r/2b</code> (round up) Given a number of
    skill points <code>s</code>, base ability score <code>b</code> and
    cost <code>c</code> of ranks is:
    <code>(&radic;(8sb/c + 1) - 1) / 2</code> (round down)

<h3>Skill Rolls</h3>
<p>
    Characters make skill rolls by determining the number of ranks
    available.  This is usually the number of ranks in one or a small
    number of skills.  At this point the character may sacrifice ranks
    in order to active special abilities.  The remaining ranks are
    converted into dice.  If the number of dice is greater than nine,
    all dice beyond the first nine are converted to the value 3 and
    added together.  The attacker may choose to replace some or all of
    the dice above six with the value 5 instead of rolling.
</p>

<p>
    The remaining dice are resolved by rolling according to the d10*
    process.  Results of 0 through 8 are converted to their face
    value.  Results of 9 are converted to 9 plus the result of another
    d10* process.
</p>

<p>
    For example, suppose a character has 8 ranks in a skill.  She
    chooses to use a special ability that costs one rank, leaving 7
    ranks.  She decides to convert one die to a 5 and roll the
    remaining six.  The face value of the dice are: 5, 3, 9, 2, 7.
    Since one of the dice was a 9 she rolls one more, which comes up
    0.  The result of the skill role is 5 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 2 + 7 + 0,
    which is 31.  This is slightly below the expected value 7 dice,
    which would be 35.  The character was a little unlucky.
</p>

<h3>Combat</h3>

<p>
    Combat can take place either in a discrete or continuous context.
    Discrete combat is divided into five second rounds and is well
    suited for table top play.  Continuous combat is well suited for
    real-time computer games.
</p>

<p>
    At any moment each character has a stamina and fatigue score.
    Stamina can never be greater than brawn times will minus fatigue.
    At the start of each round, if a character has not engaged in
    any strenuous activity one twenty fifth of maximum stamina is
    restored.  This is not rounded.  Stamina values less than one
    are effectively zero.
</p>

<h4>Status</h4>
<p>
    At any moment a character is in one of the following states:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Helpless/Unconscious: no passive dodge, no active dodge</li>
    <li>Casual/Bound: no passive dodge, active dodge</li>
    <li>Ready: passive dodge, active dodge</li>
</ul>

<h4>Attacking</h4>
<p>
    Attacks are resolved with the following system.  The attacker
    begins with the number of ranks in a base skill such as strike,
    throw or aim.  To this the attacker adds any ranks in an category
    skill such as blades or polearms.  Then the attacker adds specific
    skills such as dagger or halbard.  The total number is the number
    of ranks available.  This is used to make a skill roll which
    determines the attack score.
</p>

<p>
    Each possible weapon attack has a difficulty value.  If the attack
    score is less than this value then the attack was an embarrassing
    fumble.  Otherwise, subtract the difficulty from the attack score
    and continue.
</p>

<p>
    Every character has a passive dodge score equal to the sum of
    agility and dodge skill ranks.  When a defender is conscious and
    aware of the attacker, compare the current attack score to this
    passive dodge value.  If the attack score is smaller, the defender
    steps aside effortlessly.  Otherwise subtract the passive dodge
    score and continue.
</p>

<p>
    If the attack score is still more than zero and the defender is
    conscious and able to move, the defender active dodge must be
    resolved.  Active dodge uses stamina to reduce the attack score.
    Each point of stamina can reduce the attack by the defender
    agility.  If the defender has enough stamina to reduce the attack
    to zero or below then that many points are spent and the attack
    is narrowly avoided.  If not, the defender loses only a single
    point of stamina and the attack continues.
</p>

<p>
    Note that even if the attack is avoided in this way, the weapon
    still contacts the defender and may draw blood unless completely
    absorbed by defender armor.  A defender in defensive mode adds
    another five points to the attack score and spends enough stamina
    to reduce this to zero if possible.  This may be important if
    effects like poison are in play.
</p>

<p>
    Determine the region in which the attack lands.  (FIXME: How?)  If
    the attack score is lower than the armor coverage for that region
    then the attack strikes the armor, which will absorb some portion
    of the damage.  If not the attacker has found a gap in the armor
    and the defender takes full damage from the weapon.

<h5>Running</h5>
<h5>Climbing</h5>

<h4>Wounds</h4>
<p>
    Wounds come in three forms: critical, serious and minor.  The
    wounded character must make a brawn roll.  A wound less than a
    fifth of this roll (rounded up) is a minor wound.  A wound less
    than this roll is serious and reduces stamina by one point at the
    start of each round until treated.  A wound greater than this is
    critical and reduces stamina by two points per round until
    treated.  An arm or leg with a critical wound or two serious
    wounds cannot be used until treated.  A critical wound to the body
    renders the character helpless.  A critical wound or two serious
    wounds to the head renders the character unconscious.
</p>
<p>
    Critical wounds leave permanent scars and may instantly kill
    non-player characters.  A critical wound to the body or head will
    kill a character in a number of rounds equal to brawn ranks unless
    the character is stabilized.  (FIXME: how to stabilize?)
</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>
    Non-player characters have a personality which is described
    by five variables, each of which has one of five values:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Openness</li>
    <li>Conscientiousness</li>
    <li>Extraversion</li>
    <li>Agreeableness</li>
    <li>Neuroticism</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each variable has one of the following values:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>imperceptible (0.1)</li>
    <li>limited (0.25)</li>
    <li>typical (0.3)</li>
    <li>pronounced (0.25)</li>
    <li>extreme (0.1)</li>
</ol>

<p>
    There are 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 3,125 personality possibilities,
    though some are more common than others.
