<h1>Dekembr&aelig;</h1>

<p>
    Dekembr&aelig; is a role playing game system intended to support
    table top and computer games with a variety of genres.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
    Role playing games have been around a long time but most have
    serious problems that work against story telling and exciting
    combat.  Dekembr&aelig; seeks to address these and present a more
    robust system.
</p>

<h4>Rolling Dice for Abilities</h4>
<p>
    In the earliest role playing games players rolled dice to
    determine character abilities.  This can be exciting but players
    lose the power to construct the kinds of characters they want to
    play.  Dice also make it difficult to know whether a player
    cheated.  Finally, players can have characters with substantial
    differences in power through no virtue or fault of their own.
</p>

<h4>Character Classes</h4>
<p>
    Most role playing games make players choose a character class as
    one of the earliest steps.  This simplifies the game for players,
    which is helpful.  However, in most games this constrains the
    player choices so much that the designers feel compelled to add
    a multi-class system -- usually a cumbersome one.  Dekembr&aelig;
    seeks to reverse this by presenting a flexible base system with
    optional character classes to simplify the game when desired.
</p>

<h4>Escalating Physical Toughness</h4>
<p>
    As characters gain experience, they usually gain some form of hit
    points.  This makes experienced characters more difficult to kill
    but despite sometimes explicit explanations in source books, most
    game masters interpret this as a kind of physical resistance to
    damage.  This strains the story telling as characters endure
    increasingly absurd amounts of physical punishment.
</p>

<h4>Frequent Fumbles</h4>
<p>
    Most role playing games use flat probability distributions, in
    contrast to real world systems where bell curves are far more
    common.  This creates strange situations, such as experienced
    characters who fumble even basic tasks one time in twenty.
</p>

<h4>Awkward Balancing Mechanics</h4>
<p>
    Games in which characters can use powerful systems like fantasy
    magic must balance these abilities so that characters without such
    abilities still have important roles to play.  Unfortunately many
    role playing systems use implausible and poorly constructed
    balancing mechanisms, such as limiting powers to a small number of
    uses per day.  This strains credibility and undermines story
    telling when there are better mechanic alternatives available.
</p>

<h4>Experience Points for Kills</h4>
<p>
    The earliest role playing games rewareded characters with
    experience points for killing monsters.  This is a simple and
    direct mechanic, but it creates a structural incentive to solve as
    many problems as possible with violence.  Players who consider
    bribing or sneaking past enemies are forced to consider the loss
    of game rewards that have no direct role in the story.
</p>

<h4>Deterministic Character Speed</h4>
<p>
    In some role playing games characters have a fixed speed at which
    they can move.  This makes chase scenes predictable and dull.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bell curve distributions</li>
    <li>Deterministic character creation</li>
    <li>Flexible character creation</li>
    <li>Story friendly mechancis</li>
    <li>Plausible combat that models:
        <ul>
            <li>Striking (with or without weapons)</li>
            <li>Speed and Reach</li>
            <li>Dodging, Parrying and Binding</li>
            <li>Cover and Concealment</li>
            <li>Shields and Armor</li>
            <li>Stamina and Wounds</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Universal system for many genres</li>
</ul>

<h3>Character Abilities</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Brawn: physical toughness and strength</li>
    <li>Agility: coordination and flexibility</li>
    <li>Perception: managing complex sensory input</li>
    <li>Intellect: abstract problem solving</li>
    <li>Will: perserverance and determination</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Characters start with a score of 3 in all abilities.  Each can be
    increased by one point at a cost equal to the current value plus
    one.  A score of 4 for an ability is average.  Heroic characters
    get 50 points to spend.  Other kinds of characters may get fewer.

<p>
    Every skill has a base ability and a cost.  Characters spend skill
    points which are multiplied by the value of the base ability to
    get the effective skill level.  To determine how many skill
    points are needed to achieve <code>r</code> ranks in a skill that
    costs <code>c</code> points with a base ability <code>b</code>
    compute <code>c(r + 1)r/2b</code> (round up).  Given a number of
    skill points <code>s</code>, base ability score <code>b</code> and
    cost <code>c</code> of ranks is:
    <code>(&radic;(8sb/c + 1) - 1) / 2</code> (round down)
</p>

<p>
    The table below gives some examples with the value of the relevant
    base ability followed the skill cost after a slash.  So
    <strong>B5/C25</strong> means that the base ability has 5
    ranks and the skill cost is 25.
</p>

    The following table contains skills that are likely to be relevant
    in most game settings.  The base column contains either an ability
    or another skill which is used to convert skill points into ranks.
    When more than one entry is present in the base column, the
    highest value is used.
</p>

<table id="skillTable">

    <tr>
        <th>Skill</th><th>Base</th><th>Cost</th>

<h3>Skill Rolls</h3>
<p>
    Characters make skill rolls by rolling dice.  The number of dice
    depend on the action but is usually equal to the number of ranks
    the character has in a single skill.  Before a skill role is made
    a character sometimes has the option to sacrifice ranks to
    activate special abilities.  At most nine dice may be rolled for
    any skill roll.  Any dice beyond nine are dropped and three points
    for each are added to the result.  Players can choose to replace
    any dice above five with the value four instead.
</p>

<p>
    For example, a character with 10 ranks in a skill can choose to
    roll 9 dice and add (1 &times; 3) = 3 or can choose to roll as few
    as 5 dice, adding (4 &times; 4) + (1 &times; 3) = 16 + 3 = 19.
</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Dice</th><th>Ranks</th><th>Add</th>
        <th>Ranks</th><th>Add</th><th>Ranks</th><th>Add</th></tr>
    <tr><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>6</td>
        <td>12</td><td>9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>11</td><td>10</td>
        <td>12</td><td>13</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>14</td>
        <td>12</td><td>13</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>11</td><td>18</td>
        <td>12</td><td>21</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>19</td><td>11</td><td>22</td>
        <td>12</td><td>25</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
    The remaining dice are resolved by rolling according to the d10*
    process.  Roll a ten sided die.  Results of 0 through 8 are added
    at their face value.  Results of 9 are converted to 9 plus the
    result of another d10* process.
</p>

<p>
    For example, suppose a character has 8 ranks in a skill.  She
    chooses to use a special ability that costs one rank, leaving 7
    ranks.  She decides to convert one die to a 4 and roll the
    remaining six.  The face value of the dice are: 5, 3, 9, 2, 7.
    Since one of the dice was a 9 she rolls one more, which comes up
    0.  The result of the skill role is 4 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 2 + 7 + 0 =
    30.  This is slightly below the expected value 7 dice, which would
    be 35.  The character was a little unlucky.
</p>

<h3>Combat</h3>

<p>
    Combat can take place either in a discrete or continuous context.
    Discrete combat is divided into five second rounds and is well
    suited for table top play.  Continuous combat is well suited for
    real-time computer games.
</p>

<p>
    At any moment each character has a stamina and fatigue score.
    Stamina can never be greater than brawn times will minus fatigue.
    At the start of each round, if a character has not engaged in
    any strenuous activity one twenty fifth of maximum stamina is
    restored.  This is not rounded.  Stamina values less than one
    are effectively zero.
</p>

<h4>Status</h4>
<p>
    At any moment a character is in one of the following states:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Helpless/Unconscious: no passive dodge, no active dodge</li>
    <li>Casual/Bound: no passive dodge, active dodge</li>
    <li>Ready: passive dodge, active dodge</li>
</ul>

<h4>Attacking</h4>
<p>
    Attacks are resolved with the following system.  The attacker
    begins with the number of ranks in a base skill such as strike,
    throw or aim.  To this the attacker adds any ranks in an category
    skill such as blades or polearms.  Then the attacker adds specific
    skills such as dagger or halbard.  The total number is the number
    of ranks available.  This is used to make a skill roll which
    determines the attack score.
</p>

<p>
    Each possible weapon attack has a difficulty value.  If the attack
    score is less than this value then the attack was an embarrassing
    fumble.  Otherwise, subtract the difficulty from the attack score
    and continue.
</p>

<p>
    When a defender is conscious and aware of the attacker, compare
    the current attack score to the agility of the defender.  If the
    attack score is smaller, the defender steps aside effortlessly.
    Otherwise subtract the passive dodge score and continue.
</p>

<p>
    If the attack score is still more than zero and the defender is
    conscious and able to move, the defender active defense must be
    resolved.  Active defense uses stamina to reduce the attack score.
    Each point of stamina can reduce the attack by the defender
    agility.  If the defender has enough stamina to reduce the attack
    to zero or below then that many points are spent and the attack is
    narrowly avoided.  If not, the defender loses only a single point
    of stamina and the attack continues.
</p>

<p>
    Note that even if the attack is avoided in this way, the weapon
    still contacts the defender and may draw blood unless completely
    absorbed by defender armor.  A defender in defensive mode adds
    another five points to the attack score and spends enough stamina
    to reduce this to zero if possible.  This may be important if
    effects like poison are in play.
</p>

<p>
    Determine the region in which the attack lands.  The probability
    of the attack affecting a region is proportional to it's weight
    relative to the sum of all region weights.  If the attack score is
    lower than the armor coverage for that region then the attack
    strikes the armor, which will absorb some portion of the damage.
    If not the attacker has found a gap in the armor and the defender
    takes full damage from the weapon.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    Attack options:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Parry: use weapon ranks in place of dodge skill, stamina cost
        limited to damage dice on attacking weapon
    </li>
    <li>
        Threatening attack: spend one rank, successful attack is not
        resolved until defender tries to move or attack (attacker can
        opt to convert to training attack).
    </li>
    <li>
        Training attack: spend one rank, successful does no damage
        if attacker can succeed on a second attack role against
        difficulty and passive defense
    </li>
    <li>
        Region attack: spend two ranks, any successful attack hits the
        selected region.
    </li>
    <li>
        Disarm: spend one rank plus a number of additional ranks, on
        successful attack against defender passive defense, defender
        must succeed on attack role against attackers passive dodge
        minus additional ranks spent by attacker.
    </li>
    <li>
        Off Hand: characters have a dominant hand, using the other
        doubles difficulty and does not allow parry to add to first
        point of stamina
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Reach</h3>
<p>???</p>

<h3>Stun</h3>
<p>???</p>

<h3>Parry</h3>
<p>
    On their turn a character may choose to enter parry mode.  When
    a character is in parry mode two things change.  First, instead
    of adding dodge skill to agility for reducing attack scores, the
    total ranks the character has with one of the weapons in hand
    is used instead.  Active defense can cost no more than the number
    of damage dice done by the attacking weapon.
</p>

<p>???</p>
<p>
    (So why can't we parry a spear with a dagger?  Can we parry a
    dagger with a spear?  Maybe large reach differences reduce the
    parry effectiveness?  Maybe there's a per-weapon parry stat that
    affects the ability?  This could be a way to make shields more
    useful...)

<p>
    Each weapon has a context in which it makes the most sense.
    Some factors that affect a weapons advantages include: reach,
    range, shields, mounts, terrain, close quarters and so on.
</p>

<h3>Shields</h3>

<h3>Armor</h3>

<table>
</table>

<h3>Hit Regions</h3>
<p>
    Every character has hit regions.  For humans these regions are:
</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Region</th><th>Weight</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Head</td><td>10</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Body</td><td>30</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right Arm</td><td>15</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Left Arm</td><td>15</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Right Leg</td><td>15</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Left Leg</td><td>15</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
    Some special attacks can target a region.  Otherwise the region
    hit is determined at random according to the relative weights.
    Non-human characters may have different region maps (for instance
    there may be a tail region).
</p>

<h3></h3>

<h4>Grappling</h4>
<p>???</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>
<p>???</p>
<h5>Running</h5>
<h5>Climbing</h5>
<h5>Swimming</h5>

<h4>Wounds</h4>
<p>
    Wounds come in three forms: minor, serious and critical.  The
    wounded character must make a brawn roll.  A wound less than a
    fifth of this roll (rounded up) is a minor wound.  A wound less
    than this roll is serious and reduces stamina by one point at the
    start of each round until treated.  A wound greater than this is
    critical and reduces stamina by two points per round until
    treated.  An arm or leg with a critical wound or two serious
    wounds cannot be used until treated.  A critical wound to the body
    renders the character helpless.  A critical wound or two serious
    wounds to the head renders the character unconscious.
</p>
<p>
    A character with a serious leg wound suffers a movement penalty.
    A character with a critical leg wound or two serious wounds to the
    same leg can't stand up and has no passive defense.  A character
    with a serious arm wound must treat that arm as an off hand.  A
    character with two serious wounds or one critical wound to an arm
    cannot use that arm at all.
</p>
<p>
    Critical wounds leave permanent scars and may instantly kill
    non-player characters.  A critical wound to the body or head will
    kill a character in a number of rounds equal to brawn ranks unless
    the character is stabilized.  (FIXME: how to stabilize? how long
    to heal?  convert critical to serious to minor?)
</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>
    Non-player characters have a personality which is described
    by five variables, each of which has one of five values:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Openness</li>
    <li>Conscientiousness</li>
    <li>Extraversion</li>
    <li>Agreeableness</li>
    <li>Neuroticism</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each variable has one of the following values:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Imperceptible (0.1)</li>
    <li>Limited (0.25)</li>
    <li>Typical (0.3)</li>
    <li>Pronounced (0.25)</li>
    <li>Extreme (0.1)</li>
</ol>

<p>
    There are 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 3,125 personality possibilities,
    though some are more common than others.
